Project Description
The Facial Recognition Attendance System is an automated solution designed to streamline attendance management using facial recognition technology. Built with OpenCV and the face_recognition library, the system eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, ensuring higher accuracy, reliability, and convenience.

The system not only captures a student's facial data for identification but also tracks their entry and exit times. Based on the total time spent, it determines whether the student meets the required attendance criteria to be marked as present or absent. This functionality provides a detailed log of attendance, improving transparency and efficiency for educational institutions or workplaces.

Features
Facial Recognition:
Identifies and authenticates students by matching scanned facial images against a pre-registered database.

Entry and Exit Logging:
Records the exact time a student scans their face upon entry and exit.

Attendance Status Calculation:
Calculates the total duration spent based on entry and exit times. 
Marks the student as present or absent based on predefined time thresholds.

Automated Data Management:
Automatically saves attendance records, minimizing human error and ensuring data accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface:
Simple and intuitive for seamless operation by students and administrators.

Scalability:
Can be scaled to manage attendance for large groups of students or employees.
